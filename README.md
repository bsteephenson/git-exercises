# Git Exercises

This repository contains the exercises to my git presentation. Look in answers.txt for
solutions on how to solve these problems.

## Simple Exercises

1. Fork the repository on github

2. Open the logs and figure out how many commits there are

3. Create a file called p3.txt, add it, and commit it with a sensible message

4. Push your change to your forked repo on github

5. Reset the head so that the commit you just added is removed (in the future, don't do this after you've already pushed out a commit!)

## Advanced Exercises

1. List all of the branches (remote and local)

2. Create a branch called advanced, make 2 commits, and merge it back in with the branch. Be sure to look at what the logs are like in master now

3. Create a branch in your remote repository, then delete BOTH the remote and local branch (ie, it doesn't appear in your local git repo or in your remote repo)

4. Rebase the branch called bugfix42 onto master

5. Rebase the branch called bugfix57 onto master (hint, its located on the server branch)

6. Remove the 3 commits with the message "BAD" from server branch
